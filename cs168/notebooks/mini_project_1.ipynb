Method 4 guarantees that the 2 choices of bin are not the same, and probably also aleves the clustering issue more generally. The performance of 4 was better than 2 and 3, too, since the implementation was also simpler, so it does stand out as a possible sweet spot, assuming we can take the extra 1/3 processing time to ensure we have a good spread of bins.\n",

However, I also tried changing method 4 to use a random choice instead of always picking the first bin, and the final outcomes worsened, matching method 2 almost perfectly. Why would this be?"
